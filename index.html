    <h1>Top Five Avocado Exporters</h1>
    <p>By Gretchen Smail</p>
    <p>November 10, 2022</p>

<p>Hailed as a super food, avocadoes are everywhere: in smoothies, on toast, and even in some desserts and boba drinks. The United States is the number one importer of avocadoes, making up 35% of the world's consumption of the fruit. But the U.S. is far from being the country that produces the most avocadoes for the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Most countries that provide the rest of the world with avocadoes are located close to tropical equator â€” but climate change may continue to upend that as <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/research-coffee-cashew-avocado-growers-seriously-affected-by-climate-change/">temperatures and rainfall patterns shift</a>. (The only major exception to this is the Netherlands, which imports and then exports large quantities of avocadoes to the rest of Europe.) 
    <p>The countries that exported the most avocadoes in 2021 are:</p>
<ol type="1">
    <li>Mexico ($2.81B)</li>
    <li>Netherlands ($877M)</li>
    <li>Peru ($846M)</li>
    <li>Spain ($450M)</li>
    <li>Chile ($299M)</li>
  </ol>
